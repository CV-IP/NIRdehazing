## Requirements

Requires installation of OpenCV 3+. We can recommend [this](https://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/) guide for installing OpenCV 3+ for Python on Ubuntu. 

Other libraries required (NumPy, Matplotlib) are listed in requirements.txt. Install by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## How to use

The pipeline for dehazing using photorealistic fusion can be found in pipeline.ipynb. 
Note that you need to run run_wls.py beforehand, creating the multiresolution 
decomposition of the image. Since this is a costly operation, it has to be done only once per image,
all detail and average images are stored for later use.
